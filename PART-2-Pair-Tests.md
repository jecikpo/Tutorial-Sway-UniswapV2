# Funiswap Pair Tests

In this part of the tutorial we will create some tests the FuniswapV2Pair contract 
that was written in [part 1](https://github.com/jecikpo/Tutorial-Sway-UniswapV2/blob/main/PART-1-Pair.md).

We will use the same [framework](https://github.com/jecikpo/Tutorial-Fuel-SRC20/?tab=readme-ov-file#testing-framework-overview) for writing tests as we did in the SRC20 tutorial.

# Preparing the framework
