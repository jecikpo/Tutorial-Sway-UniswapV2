# Tutorial Sway UniswapV2 - Part 1
This tutorial explains implementation of the famous UniswapV2 DEX in Sway. We will 
see that there is a couple of differences comparing to the original Solidity code
that  we have to redesign in order to make it fit for the Fuel VM.

In this part of the tutorial we will focus only on writing the UniswapV2Pair contract
without the Oracle (we will add it in later parts). We will also write some tests.

Prerequisites:
1) Knowledge of the Fuel VM and Sway language. You can start with my previous tutorial on [SRC20](https://github.com/jecikpo/Tutorial-Fuel-SRC20)
2) Familiarity with UniswapV2 code. Great resource can be found in the [UniswapV2 Book](https://www.rareskills.io/uniswap-v2-book)
